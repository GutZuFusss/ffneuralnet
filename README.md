# Feed Forward Neural Network (From Scratch)
My first attempt at coding a neural network without using any libraries whatsoever.

## Resources
I mainly used a paper written by David J. Montana and Lawrence Davis. I used their research (or rather my interpretation of it) to programm this, so all credits go to them.
